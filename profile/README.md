# Protocol Laboratory

Protocol Laboratory is a community-driven organization focused on implementing a wide range of protocols in various programming languages. Our goal is to fill the gaps where certain programming languages lack support for specific protocols, making it easier for developers to build applications using these protocols.

## Why Protocol Laboratory?

The world of software development is constantly evolving, and new protocols are being introduced all the time. Unfortunately, not all programming languages support every protocol out of the box. This can make it difficult for developers to use these protocols in their applications, especially if they are working with a language that doesn't have built-in support.

That's where Protocol Laboratory comes in. Our community of developers is dedicated to implementing protocols in different programming languages, ensuring that developers have access to the tools they need to build powerful, protocol-based applications.

## What We Do

At Protocol Laboratory, we focus on implementing a wide range of protocols in various programming languages. Some of the protocols we have implemented include:

- Kafka
- Sms protocols(cmpp, cngp, sgip, smgp, smpp)

We also work on other protocols that are less well-known but still important for certain applications.

Our community is always looking for new protocols to implement, and we welcome contributions from developers who are interested in helping us expand our offerings.
